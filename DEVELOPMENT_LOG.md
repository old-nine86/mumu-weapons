# Development Log

This log records the long-running development history for Mumu Brick Weapons. New phases should be added at the top or bottom with date, goal, shipped changes, verification, and next step.

## 2026-05-10: Upload Quality Preview Upgrade

Goal:
- Make the upload experience clearer and make background cleaning easier to judge before submission.

Shipped:
- Added upload photo guidance chips: lay the weapon flat, use a clean background, use even lighting, and fill the frame.
- Added side-by-side upload preview: original image and cleaned cutout.
- Improved background removal thresholds for pale backgrounds, warm floor colors, shadows, and low-saturation background edges.
- Synced the same upload UI and cleaning behavior to the English site.

Verification:
- Parse scripts in `index.html`, `en/index.html`, and `admin.html`.
- Check diff formatting.

Next:
- Test with real uploaded brick weapon photos and tune the cutout thresholds if some weapon colors are removed too aggressively.

## 2026-05-10: Project Memory And Roadmap

Goal:
- Preserve the long-term project plan inside the repository.
- Make future development easier to continue without relying only on chat history.

Shipped:
- Added `PROJECT.md` as the project master plan.
- Added `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` as the ongoing phase-by-phase development record.
- Captured completed phases, near-term roadmap, long-term roadmap, and operating rules.

Verification:
- Documentation-only change.

Next:
- Continue with upload quality upgrade: cleaner background removal, better preview, and admin showcase workflow.

## 2026-05-09: Upload Recognition Upgrade

Goal:
- Make uploaded weapon recognition more accurate than the original filename/aspect-ratio heuristic.

Shipped:
- Added shape-based scoring for sword, gun, and spear/polearm.
- Added image metrics: silhouette shape, fill, color layers, center of mass, end-mass skew, symmetry, complexity, and balance.
- Added recognition confidence.
- Updated Chinese and English upload feedback.

Verification:
- Parsed scripts in `index.html`, `en/index.html`, and `admin.html`.
- Checked diff formatting.
- Published through GitHub Pages successfully.

Next:
- Improve background removal and upload preview quality.

## 2026-05-09: Upload Allowance Increased

Goal:
- Make upload quota less restrictive for early users.

Shipped:
- Changed default cloud upload allowance from 2 to 50 in Chinese site.
- Changed default cloud upload allowance from 2 to 50 in English site.
- Updated Supabase schema default from `free_per_ip = 2` to `free_per_ip = 50`.

Verification:
- Parsed scripts in `index.html`, `en/index.html`, and `admin.html`.
- Checked diff formatting.
- Published through GitHub Pages successfully.

Next:
- If the live Supabase `upload_quota_rules` row still has 2, run a one-line SQL update in Supabase.
